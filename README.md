**🥇 7th Place Achievement**

We're proud to have secured **7th place** in the prestigious Trendyol TEKNOFEST E-Commerce Hackathon, competing against numerous talented teams.

**Challenge:**
Participants worked with Trendyol's fashion-related search data and user behavior to improve click-through and conversion rates of search results. The goal was to predict and rank products for specific user-search-date sessions based on:
- Click probability (`clicked`)
- Purchase probability (`ordered`)

**Our Solution:**
We developed a machine learning ranking system that:
- Analyzed user behavior patterns
- Optimized product positioning in search results
- Balanced click and order predictions with weighted AUC metrics
- Achieved strong performance on both public and private leaderboards

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Separate AUC calculations for clicks and orders
- Weighted final score: Order predictions prioritized over clicks
- Performance across all sessions with relevant actions

**Final Scoring Breakdown:**
- 40% - Kaggle Score (Private Leaderboard)
- 30% - Demo & Presentation Quality
- 20% - Applicability
- 10% - Innovation/Creativity

This achievement demonstrates our team's capability in:
- Machine learning and ranking algorithms
